# Sample Projects ![WWiTLogo](https://github.com/waynewa/SampleProjects/WWiTLogo.ico)

This offers multiple C# sample projects based on the WWSeleniumBase Framework (https://github.com/waynewa/WWiTSeleniumBase). 
These projects are designed to provide developers with a starting point for building automated tests with Selenium WebDriver. 
While the projects are regularly updated, it's important to note that they might go out of date with some features. Therefore, 
developers should be prepared to modify the code as necessary to ensure compatibility with their specific testing needs. 
Nonetheless, the sample projects provide a solid foundation for building robust and efficient automated testing frameworks 
with Selenium WebDriver in C#.

 * SampleSpecFlowTests



### Saple API Tests

The WWSeleniumBase Framework offers developers a powerful tool for building automated tests with Selenium WebDriver. In addition 
to its browser automation capabilities, the framework also includes functionality for testing APIs. This project contains a series 
of basic API tests that are linked to the WWSeleniumBase Framework. These tests are designed to provide developers with a starting 
point for building more complex API testing scenarios. By leveraging the features of the WWSeleniumBase Framework, developers can 
create robust, scalable, and reliable API tests that can be easily integrated into their existing testing workflows. Whether you 
are a seasoned developer or just getting started with API testing, this project is a valuable resource for anyone looking to 
streamline their testing process and improve the overall quality of their software.
	
	
### Saple GUI Tests

The project that I'm referring to contains a set of basic GUI tests that are linked to the WWSeleniumBase Framework. These tests 
are designed to verify the functionality and user interface of web applications using Selenium WebDriver. The tests cover basic 
scenarios such as navigation, data entry, and form submission.By using the WWSeleniumBase Framework, developers can easily create 
and maintain automated tests that are reliable, efficient, and scalable. Furthermore, the tests in this project can be easily 
customized to fit specific testing needs, making it a valuable resource for anyone looking to build a comprehensive automated 
testing suite with Selenium WebDriver.
	
### Saple SpecFlow Tests

This Project contains a set of basic SpecFlow tests that are linked to the WWSeleniumBase Framework. These tests are designed to 
test the functionality of web applications using SpecFlow, a popular behavior-driven development (BDD) tool that allows developers 
to write test scenarios in natural language. By combining SpecFlow with the WWSeleniumBase Framework, developers can create powerful 
and comprehensive test suites that cover a wide range of scenarios. Moreover, the use of SpecFlow makes it easy to understand the test 
scenarios and to communicate the test results to stakeholders. Overall, this project provides a great starting point for anyone looking 
to implement SpecFlow tests with the WWSeleniumBase Framework.
	

## Work still in progress

This project is currently a work in progress. The developers are actively working on implementing new features and improving the 
existing ones. As with any project that is still in development, there may be bugs or issues that need to be addressed. However, 
the team is committed to ensuring that the project is stable and reliable, and they are working diligently to make sure that it 
meets the highest standards of quality. The developers are also open to feedback and suggestions from the community, and they 
encourage anyone who is interested in the project to contribute their ideas and expertise. With the ongoing work and dedication 
of the development team, this project is sure to become an even more valuable resource for developers who are looking to build 
robust and efficient automated testing frameworks.
