# Sample Projects 


This resource presents several C# sample projects derived from the WWSeleniumBase Framework (https://github.com/waynewa/WWiTSeleniumBase). The purpose of these projects is to furnish developers with a foundation for initiating automated tests using Selenium WebDriver. Although these projects undergo regular updates, it is essential to acknowledge that certain features may become outdated over time. Consequently, developers should be ready to make necessary code modifications to align with their unique testing requirements. Nonetheless, these sample projects establish a sturdy groundwork for constructing resilient and effective automated testing frameworks with Selenium WebDriver in C#.

### Saple API Tests

The WWSeleniumBase Framework is a potent tool for developers to construct automated tests using Selenium WebDriver. Beyond its capabilities in browser automation, the framework also encompasses features for API testing. This initiative comprises a set of fundamental API tests interconnected with the WWSeleniumBase Framework, serving as a foundational guide for developers venturing into more intricate API testing scenarios. By harnessing the functionalities of the WWSeleniumBase Framework, developers can forge resilient, scalable, and dependable API tests seamlessly integrated into their current testing workflows. Whether you possess extensive programming experience or are initiating your journey into API testing, this project stands as a valuable asset, facilitating the optimization of testing processes and enhancing the overall software quality.
	
	
### Saple GUI Tests

The mentioned project encompasses a collection of elementary GUI tests connected to the WWSeleniumBase Framework. These tests are specifically crafted to validate the functionality and user interface of web applications through Selenium WebDriver. They encompass fundamental scenarios like navigation, data entry, and form submission. Through the utilization of the WWSeleniumBase Framework, developers can effortlessly generate and uphold automated tests that exhibit reliability, efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, the tests within this project offer easy customization to suit particular testing requirements, rendering it an invaluable asset for those aiming to establish a comprehensive automated testing suite with Selenium WebDriver.
	
### Saple SpecFlow Tests


This project includes a series of fundamental SpecFlow tests interconnected with the WWSeleniumBase Framework. These tests are crafted to assess the functionality of web applications using SpecFlow, a widely used behavior-driven development (BDD) tool that enables developers to articulate test scenarios in natural language. Through the integration of SpecFlow and the WWSeleniumBase Framework, developers can construct robust and all-encompassing test suites spanning a diverse array of scenarios. Additionally, the incorporation of SpecFlow facilitates clear comprehension of the test scenarios and seamless communication of test results to stakeholders. In essence, this project serves as an excellent starting point for those seeking to implement SpecFlow tests with the WWSeleniumBase Framework.
